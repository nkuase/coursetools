Rewrite rps2.py in the same directory with the following:
1. Use PyQt6
2. It copies a clipboard to remove the prepended spaces and copies it back.
3. It has two windows/texts to show the difference between the two.
4. It has a button "process" that processes the input from the right button and shows the results in the right text.
5. It automatically copies back the content, but it also allows users copy from the right text.
6. Before it starts the work, it checks if it has the prepended spaces. If not, show message that it doesn't have to do the work.
7. After the work, it compares the input and output check if it really removes the prepended spaces.

The check should start from the line 1. If the line 1 has N spaces, remove N spaces all the following lines. If the line doesn't have N spaces, remove spaces as much as possible. Rewrite.
